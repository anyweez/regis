<h2>How Regis Works</h2>
  <p>Regis releases one question to you every other day.  A new question will be immediately released
     if you're able to solve one of the problems available to you.</p>
  <p>The question database contains a series of templates that can be personalized for each user.  Each
     question that you receive has a very high probability of being unique among all users, but is similar
     enough that it should be possible to discuss algorithmic approaches to solving it if you'd like to.</p>
  <h3>How Regis Learns</h3>
  <p>Regis records actions that you make on the site, including correct and incorrect guesses.  We're
     able to get a general feel for the difficulty of particular problem after enough users have attempted
     it, and are also able to get a feel for your conceptual strengths and weaknesses after you've attempted
     enough questions.  In addition, the feedback you provide after correctly answering a question plays
     a significant role in determining your interests and comfort level with particular topics.</p>
  <p>The learning system itself is still in its very early stages and will be changing quite a bit.</p>
