<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
  Codepath is here for one reason: to help you practice your algorithmic thinking skills.  We provide
  you with a single programming problem to focus on at a time and learn your strengths and weaknesses as you work.
</p>
<p>
  Codepath is language-agnostic.  Use it to practice a language you already know or even to learn one
  that you've never used before.
